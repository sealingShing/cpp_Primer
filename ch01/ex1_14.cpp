     * The main difference between the `for`'s and the `while`'s is a matter of pragmatics:
     * we usually use `for` when there is a known number of iterations,
     * and use `while` constructs when the number of iterations in not known in advance.
     * The `while` vs `do ... while` issue is also of pragmatics,
     * the second executes the instructions once at start,
     * and afterwards it behaves just like the simple `while`.
